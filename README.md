# k-MWP

## Compile & Run

The source code of our paper is in the folder "src".

The source code of each algorithm for k-MWP identification (i.e., Base, MWPA-, MWPA) has three parameters, corresponding to the dataset name (e.g., -g g1) , the insteger k (e.g., -k 2) and the algorithm (e.g., -a MWPA)

## Datasets

We provide five sample datasets in the folder "dataset" for testing, g1 - g3.
